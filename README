Building all the gstreamer + fluendo's public plugins with jhbuild
==================================================================

 * Build and install jhbuild from GNOME svn

 * You might want to edit the 'gstreamer.jhbuildrc' to fine-tune the
   set of plugins to build

 * run 'jg build'


Note: by default the official gstreamer moduleset is taken straight
from the net every time you run 'jg'. If you want to be more
independent you can run

  'git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/jhbuild jhbuild.git'

and change the includes at the top of the 'selected.modules'.
